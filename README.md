# DNC-EthernetTSN

This code implements Network Calculus modeling and analysis solutions to provide results for the paper **Modeling and Analysis of Time-Aware Shaper on Half-Duplex Ethernet PLCA Multidrop** published in the **IEEE Transactions on Communications**.

[The latest draft of the paper can be downloaded here.](./Paper_TAS_PLCA.pdf)

**DNC-EthernetTSN** is a Network Calculus-based tool (used as an extension of the [DNC tool](https://github.com/NetCal/DNC)) for calculating worst-case bounds on Time-Aware Shaper (TAS)-based Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) networks and its integration with Physical Layer Collision Avoidance (PLCA) multidrop networks. 

**DNC-EthernetTSN** tool is part of the achieved results in the PhD of **David A. Nascimento** at Centro de InformÃ¡tica (CIn) / Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) - Brazil.

# How to use this repository?

1. Clone the DNC repository following the instructions on https://github.com/NetCal/DNC 

2. Clone this repository in your computer and import **DNC-EthernetTSN** project in Eclipse in "File" -> "Import" -> "General" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"

# How to run this code?

Run main file **Ethernet_IEEE_TransOnComm_2022_paper.java** of package **org.networkcalculus.dnc.ethernet.demos**.

The results will be stored in the **results** directory. 
They include:
- Excel sheets with all calculated parameters of each TAS window.
- Chart for each TAS window and their combination regarding the multidrop access with PLCA in each scheduling case.
- Chart for each Arrival and Service Curves used in each scheduling case.
- ServerGraph for each scheduling case that enables it to be run into DNC if one wants.
- Excel sheets with all results for all scheduling cases.
